## 2. Business Goals

### 2.1 Key Business Challenges

Crypto exchanges need deep, tight, and resilient markets to remain competitive and deliver the best trading experience to users. However, maintaining strong liquidity across multiple trading pairs — especially under volatile market conditions — is difficult.

Trading teams and leadership need real-time answers to questions like:
- How effectively is liquidity being provided?
- Which market makers are performing best?
- Where do liquidity gaps or inefficiencies exist?
- How do external market conditions impact liquidity?

### 2.2 Core Business Objectives

The liquidity analytics project is designed to help a crypto exchange understand how well its market is functioning. The goal is to support trading teams, product managers, and executives by giving them clear, real-time insights into:

- **How easy it is for users to buy or sell without big price changes** (tight spreads, deep order book)
- **How active and reliable the market makers are**, especially during busy or volatile times
- **Which trading pairs have strong or weak liquidity**, so they know where to improve
- **How to reward market makers who do a good job**, and push others to improve
- **How the exchange compares to competitors**, in terms of liquidity quality

In short, we want to make sure the exchange has a healthy market that is fast, stable, and cost-effective for all users — and that the people running it can track and improve that over time.
